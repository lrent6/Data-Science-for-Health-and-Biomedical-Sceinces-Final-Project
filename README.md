# Data Science for Health and Biomedical Sceinces Final Project
## Overveiw
This repository contains the code and data for the final programming assignment for the Data Sceince for Health and Biomedical Sciences class at the University of Edinburgh run by Dr Kasia Banas.
For the programming asignemnt we were told to use availible cencus data to create a report assessing public health in an area of our choosing. The project I came up with was to asses if NHS Health
Boards with higher proportions of older people have higher rates of prescription of the three main medications used to treat Alzheimerâ€™s Disease symptoms, as I beleived this would be a useful analaysis as it could give an indication as to
whether Alzheimer Diseases is more prevalent in certain areas of Scotland and assess if in the future we could use proportion of older people in a population to predict where to focus resources for treatment of the disease.
