# Data Science for Health and Biomedical Sceinces Final Project
## Overveiw
This repository contains the code and data for the final programming assignment for the Data Sceince for Health and Biomedical Sciences class at the University of Edinburgh run by Dr Kasia Banas.
For the programming asignemnt we were told to use availible cencus data to create a report assessing public health in an area of our choosing. The project I came up with was to asses if NHS Health
Boards with higher proportions of older people have higher rates of prescription of the three main medications used to treat Alzheimer’s Disease symptoms, as I beleived this would be a useful analaysis as it could give an indication as to
whether Alzheimer Diseases is more prevalent in certain areas of Scotland and assess if in the future we could use proportion of older people in a population to predict where to focus resources for treatment of the disease.

## Contents
- data : Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- report : Contains a pdf of the final report for the project.
- script : contains a RMD file of code
- figures : contains all the figures produced for the project

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following software and packages:
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended)
- R packages:
  - knitr
  - formatR
  - dplyr
  - tidyverse
  - ggplot2
  - gt
  - stringr
  - janitor
  - readxl
  - readr

These packages can be installed in R using the following commands:

```install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "knitr", "formatR", "gt", "stringr", "janitor", "readxl", "readr"))```

## Data 
Most data required to run this code is pulled from the internet when the script is run. The additional dataset required can be found in the data folder called "2011_Censusv0.1".
